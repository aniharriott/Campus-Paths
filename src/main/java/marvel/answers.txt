Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW 3-4 and why
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

I changed the implementation of my GraphEdge constructor and the addEdge method of my Graph so that an edge that is created
is not added to its source nodes and destination nodes in coming and out going edges until it is added to the graph those
nodes are in. I did this so that the addEdge method in my graph was more singular in the function it performed, and so that
a graph could have the rep invariant that it would have no edges pointing to or from nodes not in the graph.

I also changed my Graph and added another field that keeps track of the edges in the graph. I did this because it helps
to reduce iteration when there is a need to identify what edges are in the graph, and it made my addEdge method more
singular in its function. It also means that my client no longer needs to track what edges are in the graph.

The addEdge function in my graph also no longer creates and adds a new edge, it just adds. I did this because the
method should have a more singular function.
