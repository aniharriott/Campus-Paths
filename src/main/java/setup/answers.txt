Problem 6.

(a) Fibonacci failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because the code designated the input of 0 as a
    negative number and threw an exception for that, however 0 is not negative and therefore not an invalid input
    that needs an exception thrown. All I changed was the condition in the if statement for the
    IllegalArgumentException, I altered it to if(n < 0) instead of if(n <= 0).

(b) Fibonacci failed the testBaseCase test because it threw an exception when passed the base case input of 0 when
    it should have returned 1. The modifications I made to fix the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test were
    sufficient to also fix this test, the if statement before the IllegalArgumentException was altered to if(n < 0)
    instead of if(n <= 0).

(c) Fibonacci failed the testInductiveCase test because the else/if condition and the math in the else statement were
    not returning the desired term in the Fibonacci sequence. To fix this I changed the else/if condition to
    else if (n < 2) instead of else if (n <= 2), and I changed the return statement to add the two recursive calls
    of getFibTerm instead of subtracting them.
