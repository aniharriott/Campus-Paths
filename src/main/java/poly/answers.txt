Problem 0.

(a) r = p * q:
        set r = 0 (a polynomial)
        {Inv: r = q*p_0 + q*p_1 + ... + q*p_n-1, where p_n is the nth term in p}
        for each term, t_p, in p:
            set s = 0 (a polynomial)
            {Inv: s = t_p*q_0 + t_p*q_1 + ... + t_p*q_n-1, where q_n is the nth term in q}
            for each term, t_q, in q:
                multiply the coefficients of t_p and t_q
                add the exponents of t_p and t_q
                use new coefficient and new exponent to make a new term and add that to s
            use polynomial addition to add s to r (will condense like terms)

     DEFINITION OF ADDITION OF TERM AND POLYNOMIAL
     r = p + t_0:
        set r = p
        t_0 = the term
        {Inv: r = (t_p0+t_0) + (t_p1+t_0) + ... + (t_pn-1+t_0)}
        for each term, t_r, in r:
            if any term in t_r matches the exponent of t_0:
                then replace t_r with the sum of t_r and t_0
                else insert t_0 to r as a new term

(b) q = u / v:
        set q = 0
        set u_change = u
        set t_u = highest degree term of u_change
        set t_v = highest degree term of v
        {Inv: q = t_u_0/t_v + t_u_1/t_v + ... + t_u_n-1/t_v}
        while the highest degree of v is < the highest degree of u_change:
            set t_coefficient = 0
            if the coefficient of t_u_change % the coefficient of t_v = 0:
                then divide the coefficient of t_u_change by that of t_v and the result is set to t_coefficient
                else t_coefficient is "(coefficient of t_u_change)/(coefficient of t_v)"
            subtract the exponent of t_v from the exponent of t_u_change and set as t_exponent
            set t_temp = a new polynomial term with t_coefficient as its coefficient and t_exponent as its exponent
            add t_temp to q
            set v_temp = multiply t_temp by v
            set u_change = u_change - v_temp

    DEFINITION OF POLYNOMIAL SUBTRACTION
    r = p - q:
        set r = q by making a term-by-term copy of all terms in q to r
        {Inv: r = q - p_0 - p_1 - ... - p_i-1, where p_i is the ith term in p}
        for each term, t_p, in p:
            if any term, t_r, in r has the same degree as t_p,
                then replace t_r in r with the difference of t_p and t_r
                else insert t_p into r as a new negative term

    DEFINITION OF MULTIPLICATION WITH A TERM AND A POLYNOMIAL
    r = t * p:
        set r = p by making a term-by-term copy of all terms in p to r
        {Inv: r = p_0*t + p_1*t + ... + p_n-1*t}
        for each term, t_r, in r:
            multiply term t by t_r

(c) Example: (x^3+x-1) / (x+1) = x^2-x+2

    u = (x^3+x-1)
    v = (x+1)
    q = 0
    set u_change = u
    t_u = x^3
    t_v = x
    while the highest degree of v is <= the highest degree of u_change:

        ITERATION 1: u_change = (x^3+x-1), v = (x+1), q = 0, t_u_change = x^3, t_v = x
        [if the coefficient of t_u_change % the coefficient of t_v = 0:] YES 1%1 = 0
            [then divide the coefficient of t_u_change by that of t_v and the result is set to t_coefficient] 1/1 = 1 = t_coefficient
            [else t_coefficient is "(coefficient of t_u_change)/(coefficient of t_v)"]
        [subtract the exponent of t_v from the exponent of t_u_change and set as t_exponent] t_exponent = 3 - 1 = 2
        [set t_temp = a new polynomial term with t_coefficient as its coefficient and t_exponent as its exponent] t_temp = x^2
        [add t_temp to q] q = 0 + x^2 => q = x^2
        [set v_temp = multiply t_temp by v] v_temp = x^2 * (x+1) => v_temp = (x^3+x^2)
        [set u_change = u_change - v_temp] u_change = (x^3+x-1) - (x^3+x^2) => u_change = (-x^2+x-1)

        ITERATION 2: u_change = (-x^2+x-1), v = (x+1), q = x^2, t_u_change = -x^2, t_v = x
        [if the coefficient of t_u_change % the coefficient of t_v = 0:] YES -1%1 = 0
            [then divide the coefficient of t_u_change by that of t_v and the result is set to t_coefficient] -1/1 = -1 = t_coefficient
            [else t_coefficient is "(coefficient of t_u_change)/(coefficient of t_v)"]
        [subtract the exponent of t_v from the exponent of t_u_change and set as t_exponent] t_exponent = 2 - 1 = 1
        [set t_temp = a new polynomial term with t_coefficient as its coefficient and t_exponent as its exponent] t_temp = -x^1 = -x
        [add t_temp to q] q = x^2 + -x => q = x^2-x
        [set v_temp = multiply t_temp by v] v_temp = -x * (x+1) => v_temp = (-x^2-x)
        [set u_change = u_change - v_temp] u_change = (-x^2+x-1) - (-x^2-x) => u_change = (2x-1)

        ITERATION 3: u_change = (2x-1), v = (x+1), q = x^2-x, t_u_change = 2x, t_v = x
        [if the coefficient of t_u_change % the coefficient of t_v = 0:] YES 2%1 = 0
            [then divide the coefficient of t_u_change by that of t_v and the result is set to t_coefficient] 2/1 = 2 = t_coefficient
            [else t_coefficient is "(coefficient of t_u_change)/(coefficient of t_v)"]
        [subtract the exponent of t_v from the exponent of t_u_change and set as t_exponent] t_exponent = 1 - 1 = 0
        [set t_temp = a new polynomial term with t_coefficient as its coefficient and t_exponent as its exponent] t_temp = 2x^0 = 2
        [add t_temp to q] q = x^2-x+2
        [set v_temp = multiply t_temp by v] v_temp = 2*(x+1) => v_temp = 2x+2
        [set u_change = u_change - v_temp] u_change = (2x-1) - (2x+2) => u_change = (-3)
