Problem 0.

(a) r = p * q:
        set r = 0 (a polynomial)
        {Inv: r = q*p_0 + q*p_1 + ... + q*p_n-1, where p_n is the nth term in p}
        for each term, t_p, in p:
            set s = 0 (a polynomial)
            {Inv: s = t_p*q_0 + t_p*q_1 + ... + t_p*q_n-1, where q_n is the nth term in q}
            for each term, t_q, in q:
                multiply the coefficients of t_p and t_q
                add the exponents of t_p and t_q
                use new coefficient and new exponent to make a new term and add that to s
            use polynomial addition to add s to r (will condense like terms)

     DEFINITION OF ADDITION OF TERM AND POLYNOMIAL
     r = p + t_0:
        set r = p
        t_0 = the term
        {Inv: r = (t_p0+t_0) + (t_p1+t_0) + ... + (t_pn-1+t_0)}
        for each term, t_r, in r:
            if any term in t_r matches the exponent of t_0:
                then replace t_r with the sum of t_r and t_0
                else insert t_0 to r as a new term

(b) q = u / v:
        set q = 0
        {Inv: q = u_prev0FirstTerm/v_prev0FirstTerm + u_prev1FirstTerm/v_prev1FirstTerm +
            ... + u_prevn-1FirstTerm/v_prevn-1FirstTerm}
        while the highest degree of v is < the highest degree of u:
            set t_u = highest degree term of u
            set t_v = highest degree term of v
            set t_coefficient = 0
            if the coefficient of t_u % the coefficient of t_v = 0:
                then divide the coefficient of u by that of v and the result is set to t_coefficient
                else t_coefficient is "(coefficient of u)/(coefficient of v)"
            subtract the exponent of t_v from the exponent of t_u and set as t_exponent
            set t_temp = a new polynomial term with t_coefficient as its coefficient and t_exponent as its exponent
            add t_temp to q
            set v_temp = multiply t_temp by v
            set u = u - v_temp

    DEFINITION OF POLYNOMIAL SUBTRACTION
    r = p - q:
        set r = q by making a term-by-term copy of all terms in q to r
        {Inv: r = q - p_0 - p_1 - ... - p_i-1, where p_i is the ith term in p}
        foreach term, t_p, in p:
            if any term, t_r, in r has the same degree as t_p,
                then replace t_r in r with the difference of t_p and t_r
            else insert t_p into r as a new negative term
