Problem 0.

(a) r = p * q:
        set r = empty
        {Inv: r = q*p_0 + q*p_1 + ... + q*p_n-1, where p_n is the nth term in p}
        for each term, t_p, in p:
            set s = empty
            {Inv: s = t_p*q_0 + t_p*q_1 + ... + t_p*q_n-1, where q_n is the nth term in q}
            for each term, t_q, in q:
                multiply the coefficients of t_p and t_q
                add the degrees of t_p and t_q
                add new term to s
            use polynomial addition to add s to r (will condense like terms)
