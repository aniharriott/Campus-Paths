I collaborated with Kaytlin Melvin.

We discussed in 1.c. what exactly the problem was asking, and talked about the difference between representation
exposure and breaking the representation invariant - particularly in the examples asked about.

We talked about problem 2 and reasoned through together what methods in what classes would be necessary to achieve
certain basic functions of a graph, and what was necessary to achieve functions identified in the spec test script.
We talked about the benefits and drawbacks of using different implementations of fields in classes.

We also discussed problem 3. We both struggled at first to figure out exactly how to write the spec tests and how
specific each spec test file needed to be, together we came to a conclusion on how to approach the spec tests and
how to approach the implementation tests in terms of format. We also talked about different cases to test and
discussed whether certain code made sense as a test when wither of us got stuck.
