Problem 1. (Written exercises)

(a) IntQueue1:
        Abstraction Function:
            AF(r) = IntQueue1 q1 such that
                entries = elements in the queue, where
                entries.get(0) = first element in queue, last out
                entries.get(size-1) = last element in queue, first out
        Rep Invariant:
            entries != null
    IntQueue2:
        Abstraction Function:
            AF(r) = IntQueue2 q2 such that
                entries = elements in the queue
                front = first element in the queue
                size = the number of elements in the queue
                entries[front+size-1] = the last element in the queue
        Rep Invariant:
            entries != null

(b) My groupings were: (c = f), (a = g = d), (b = h), (e)

(c) 1. This method would not expose the representation. Given the information available, I am assuming the method just
       performs a computation that doesn't impact or change the fields of the object class the method is in.
    2.
    3. This method could expose the representation because it's a private method. It could be called while the rep is in
       an intermediate state that doesn't satisfy the rep invariant.
