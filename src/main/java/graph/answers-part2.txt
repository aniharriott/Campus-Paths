Problem 1.

 (a) A collection of edges would provide for a very simple and easy implementation, however it would make it more difficult
     to keep track nodes and would create more computations when trying to find or add nodes. An adjacency list would
     make it easier to find certain nodes and find what they connect to, however the implementation of this would be the
     more complicated than just a collection of edges. An adjacency matrix would make finding a path between nodes the
     most straightforward out of all the implementations, and it would hold the most information without additional computation
     being necessary. However, an adjacency matrix is also very complicated to implement and contains a lot of unnecessary
     information - the only relevant information about edges is what they connect to, it is not also necessary to know
     every edge they do not connect to.

 (b) I chose to implement the graph as a collection of nodes, where each node is associated with its in coming and out
     going edges. The advantage of this is that it reduces the computations necessary to find paths, but a disadvantage
     is that it is more complicated to implement and requires additional class definitions.
