# Test that findMinPath will return the shortest cost path

created graph graph1

added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

added edge 6.000 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge 7.000 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge 1.000 from n1 to n3 in graph1

path from n1 to n3:
n1 to n3 with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
