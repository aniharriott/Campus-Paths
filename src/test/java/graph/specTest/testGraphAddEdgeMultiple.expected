# Test Graph addEdge multiple file.
# Tests if multiple edges can be
# added to a graph when they use
# different nodes.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n3 to n4 in graph1
