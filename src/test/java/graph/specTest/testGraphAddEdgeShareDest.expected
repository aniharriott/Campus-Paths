# Test Graph addEdge share destination file.
# Tests if two edges can be added that
# have the same destination node but different
# source nodes.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n3 to n2 in graph1
