# Test Graph listChildren circle file.
# Tests if only one child is printed
# when the parent node has a path of
# edges back to itself.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge e3 from n3 to n1 in graph1

# Print children of n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
