# Test Graph listChildren multiple edges file.
# Tests that there is a separate entry printed
# for children nodes that have multiple edges
# pointing to them from the parent.

# Create graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print children from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2)
